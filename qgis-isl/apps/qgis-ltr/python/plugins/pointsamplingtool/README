The Point Sampling Tool Plugin collects polygon attributes from multiple layers
at specified sampling points.
You need a point layer with locations of sampling points and at least
one polygon or raster layer for probe values from. Then the plugin creates
new point layer with locations given by the sampling points
and attributes taken from all the underlying polygons or/and raster cells.
