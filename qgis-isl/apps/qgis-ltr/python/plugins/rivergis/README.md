RiverGIS is a [QGIS plugin](http://qgis.org/) that helps you create HEC-RAS flow model. HEC has developed an excellent tool for that, the [HEC-GeoRAS](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-georas/) for ArcGIS. While HEC-GeoRAS can be downloaded and run at no cost, the ArcGIS licence can drain your pocket heavily. RiverGIS, released under the [GNU General Public License](<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html), brings the power of HEC-GeoRAS into the [free/libre software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) world.
